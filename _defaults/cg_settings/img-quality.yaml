description: 'This affects the file size of generated images, and thereby also the loading time of each page. Please note that all images in Romanesco are resized first, before being displayed in the browser. This means you don''t have to worry about file sizes when uploading images in MODX. In fact, it''s better to upload high quality images (1-3 MB) because the image processor gives better results if it has good source files.'
