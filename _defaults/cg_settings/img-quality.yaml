description: 'This affects the file size of all images, and thereby also the loading time of each page. Set it to Low if you feel speed is more important and only use High or Max if you are certain that most of your visitors have a good internet connection. This setting can be overridden in various places, so don''t worry about any images coming out ugly.'
