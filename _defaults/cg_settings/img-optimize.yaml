description: 'By default, the images are already thumbnailed to their appropriate size(s) by MODX, using the quality setting above. This works fine as far as image quality is concerned, but from a performance perspective, things could be better. The generated JPG and PNG thumbnails are still quite large, so they require more time to load. The solution is to use a post processor (in this case a library called Squoosh, which needs to be installed on your server), which optimizes the thumbnail to reduce file size and creates an alternative version in a modern image format (in this case WebP). This drastically reduces file size, without sacrificing image quality.'
