# In order to prevent "directory not found" issues when adding media after
# installation, a .gitignore file is added to all default Romanesco folders.
#
# Git doesn't include empty folders by default, so the added .gitignore files
# basically act as bait to get the folders included in the repository.

# Ignore everything in this directory
*

# Except for:
!.gitignore
